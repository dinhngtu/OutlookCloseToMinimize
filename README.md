Installation
------------

Double-click `OutlookCloseToMinimizeSetup.exe`.

The addin works best when the "Hide when minimized" option is enabled (by right-clicking Outlook's tray icon):

Addin cannot be disabled
------------------------

Thanks to Outlook which disables the addin after some time, I had to add a setting to force enable the addin.
If you don't need the addin any more, simply uninstall it.

If Outlook crashes
------------------

If Outlook crashes, simply run `outlook.exe /safe` and remove the addin manually from Options - Add-ins.

Licensed under GPL version 3.

I tested the addin with Outlook 365 and .NET 4.7.2, but in theory it should work with older Outlook versions with no problem.
